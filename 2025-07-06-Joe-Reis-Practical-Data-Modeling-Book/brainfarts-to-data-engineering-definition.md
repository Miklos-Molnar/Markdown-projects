I found the **evolution of the data engineering definitions** in the article truly inspiring — it gave me a great opportunity to reflect on and articulate **my own understanding of the concept**.  

**Data engineering** is a deliberate and evolutionary data practice that—through piloting, rapid feedback loops, and adaptive re-design—not only structures and integrates data into systems, but also prepares it for accessible and business-meaningful use within a connected enterprise data ecosystem.  
This is done in alignment with corporate governance, ensuring quality assurance, resource-awareness, operational optimization, scalability, automation, and measurability—so that operations remain reliably resilient to change, DevOps-aligned, and capable of supporting long-term sustainability.
