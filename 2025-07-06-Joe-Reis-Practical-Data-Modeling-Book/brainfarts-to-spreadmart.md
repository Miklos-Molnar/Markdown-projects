**PART-1. Data Governance Reloaded: When SQLs Speak and Git Listens**  
(Subtitle: Channeling Decentralized Knowledge – Starting from How Companies Actually Work)  

Let’s be honest: there’s no single definition of anything in a company — just layers and layers of embedded workarounds.  

The real-world data landscape inside most organizations? Far from unified. Even something as basic as the term “customer” gets twisted into a dozen meanings, depending on who’s asking and where:  
* “Active customers” filtered manually in Excel,  
* high-value segments stashed away in Access files,  
* loyalty tags pulled from Looker dashboards,  
* definitions spun out from prompt-based tooling,  
* SQL snippets handcrafted on analysts’ laptops that never see daylight.  

Welcome to **SpreadMart 2.0**, or as Joe Reis puts it: a vibe-coded workaround culture that’s stretching the limits of centralized data platforms beyond breaking.  

But what if the solution isn’t to suppress this fragmentation — but to channel it?  

What if we accepted the messiness and treated each SQL query, prompt, or dashboard as its own unit of knowledge?  
And then built a system that doesn’t just store them, but **learns from them**, makes them **searchable**, and allows reuse **without reinvention**?  

It’s not just about building another metadata catalog. The goal is more radical:  
**Make the official system easier and cheaper to use than hacking Excel and hoping it works.**  

**The Matryoshka Principle: Not Conflicting Definitions — Nested Ones**  

Picture this: An internal SQL parser quietly walks through your company’s codebase and dashboards.  
It tries to understand:  
* how different teams define “customer,”  
* what joins, filters, and groupings they use to narrow it down,  
* what entities show up again and again,  
* and how the actual result sets **converge** or diverge — like layers of a matryoshka doll.  

The output?  
A **visual, hierarchical, nested map** of overlapping definitions.  
Not one “true” version, but a **stack of perspectives** — each one valid for a different purpose:  
 * the marketer’s version,  
 * the legal team’s version,  
 * the finance controller’s version.  

It’s not about controlling the narrative — it’s about finally **mapping the reality**.  
Git as a Company’s Knowledge Backbone  

Next step: lock it in.  

The rule?  
**“If you want to publish a dashboard, you need to submit your SQL too.”**  

Doesn’t matter where the logic lives — Excel, Looker, a Notion doc, or a prompt. But somewhere, there needs to be a **central git-based repo** where:  
* the logic has a unique ID,  
* its history is trackable,  
* it’s discoverable and reusable,  
* and it can be inspected (e.g., “who else used this filter logic?”).  

Same goes for prompts.  
Why not have a **git for prompts too**? They’re fast becoming vessels of business logic and tacit knowledge, just like SQL.  
The Incentive: Don’t Enforce It — Make It Cheaper  

This isn’t about control, punishment, or bureaucratic checklists.  
The goal is to make using the shared system **faster, easier, and more reliable** than everyone building their own lonely logic.  

And the only real rule might be:  
**“If we can’t trace it, we don’t use it to make decisions.”**  

That’s not heavy-handed governance.  
It’s **lightweight alignment**.  
Not policing — but building a collective knowledge base with built-in traceability.  

Let people continue working the way they work — just give them a low-friction path to plug their thinking into something bigger.  
Not because they’re forced to,  
but because it’s just plain smarter.  

**OPTIONAL: A friendly layer on top of git: let’s be honest — no one wants to grep JSON**  
Yes, everything goes into git. Prompts, SQLs, definitions, version histories — the whole knowledge base.  

But here’s the thing: most business users don’t want to browse folders or read YAML.  
What they do want:  
* to search by keyword (“customer who churned last year”),  
* to compare versions side-by-side,  
* to see visual trees of how definitions nest or differ,  
* and to ask: “Who else defined this term similarly?”  

That’s why you need a semantic UI on top — call it a “definition explorer,” “logic atlas,” or “curiosity console.”  
Whatever you name it, it’s where the collective intelligence of your company becomes navigable by humans.  
Without that, git is just a cold archive.  
With it, you get a living, breathing map of business meaning.  


**PART-2 Metadata, Reloaded: How a Company Can Digest Its Own SQLs**  
(Subtitle: Semi-automated governance, prompt-git, and the rise of the meta-data engineer)  

In the previous post, I laid out a wild but workable idea:  
What if the swamp of corporate SQLs, ad-hoc dashboards, and prompt-hacked insights wasn’t a mess to clean up — but a knowledge system waiting to be channeled, learned from, and scaled?  

Now comes the how.  

**1.Automated governance isn’t a myth — it just needs different architecture**  
Imagine a parser that does more than syntax checking.  

This thing crawls through your internal SQLs and:  
* identifies the core business entity in each query (say, customer),  
* untangles the joins, filters, and groupings,  
* spots overlaps (e.g. multiple definitions pointing at the same subset),  
* and maps all this into a visual matrix or hierarchy showing how the resulting data sets narrow or diverge.  

This isn’t “just” technical parsing. It’s business semantics reverse-engineering.  
We don’t care if your SQL is tidy — we care what business meaning it encodes.  

The goal? Not full automation, but high-leverage automation:  
* Let machines digest 80% of it.  
* For the tricky 20%, bring in a human — but not just any human...  

**2.Enter the meta-data engineer: curator, builder, semantic translator**  
This is a new kind of data engineer. One who:  
* doesn’t just build pipelines,  
* but maps how queries and dashboards express business thinking,  
* doesn’t just write ETL,  
* but traces the relationships between business concepts (e.g., what makes a customer “inactive,” “high-value,” or “relevant”?),  
* doesn’t produce documentation after the fact,  
* but codes metadata into the system itself, helping machines learn to categorize similar logic next time.  

Part librarian, part developer, part data anthropologist.  

**3.Prompts are metadata too — deal with it**  
Everything we just said about SQL? Apply it to prompts.  
A good system should be able to track:  
* who asks what,  
* about which entities,  
* using what filtering language,  
* and with what end goal (insight, aggregation, chart, etc.).  

Prompts deserve the same lifecycle:  
* stored in git,  
* versioned,  
* tagged with purpose,  
* searchable,  
* reusable.  

A future metadata system won’t just know what “customer” means.  
It will know what people actually asked about customers — what they cared about, how often, and how they phrased it.  

That’s not a catalog — that’s a map of collective curiosity.  

**4.Feedback loops and A/B testing business logic**  
Let’s say you’ve got three competing definitions of “active customer.” Happens all the time.  
We should be able to track:  
* which definition is used more often,  
* which one caused confusion,  
* which one failed an audit,  
* and which one actually led to better business decisions (even via proxy metrics).  

This isn’t just a list of terms.  
It’s a **self-reflective system** — where definitions compete, evolve, and leave traceable outcomes.  

Not “one final truth,”  
but **transparent pluralism**, documented and navigable.  

**5.Metadata isn’t a goal. It’s an efficiency multiplier**  
The point isn’t to create some documentation utopia where we can bathe in taxonomies and diagrams.  
The point is:  
* fewer useless redefinitions,  
* less reinventing the wheel every time a new report is built,  
* faster path to relevant examples,  
* and actual feedback when a definition isn’t working.  

Your metadata layer should never be the central police force.  
It should be the **catalyst** for velocity.  

One final thought  

It’s not control that kills data work — it’s the lack of traceability.  
If we can turn the jungle of corporate SQLs and prompt-spawned logic into something **structured, navigable, and visual**,  
we don’t just get governance —  
we get a system that can **learn from itself**.  

And the best part?  
This isn’t theory anymore.  
It’s buildable. Just differently.  

### COMMENT: 
"I agree with the concept that we should try to reflect real life in the systems rather than dictate. But not entirely sure of our ability to glean real life from SQLs."

### MY ANSWER:
**Totally valid concern** — I struggle with it too. The goal isn’t to treat SQL as “the truth,” but to see it as the clearest trace of how someone *thought* about a business concept.  
Read enough of them, and patterns start to form — and that’s where interpretation begins.

Here are a few ideas to make SQL reverse-engineering less painful (without diving into side-effects):

### 1. AI-based intent extraction  
Modern models can already extract rough business logic from SQL.  
This helps surface implicit mental models (like how `active_customer` varies by context) and transitions tacit knowledge into structured insight.

### 2. AI-assisted SQL parsing (e.g. via ANTLR)  
A robust, syntax-aware approach that works standalone or paired with AI.  
Great for extracting joins, filters, and entities as metadata anchors.

### 3. Governance-focused SQL linting  
Live feedback while writing — not just post-mortem.  
Helps promote consistency (e.g. required aliases, no `SELECT *`), improves traceability, and reinforces team-wide patterns.

*Would love to hear what’s worked for others here too.*

### What would I recommend as SQL writing standards at the company level?

**Goal:** As few hard constraints as possible, and as many soft incentives and built-in support mechanisms as we can.

**Suggested practices and expectations:**
- Every SQL should start with a short goal comment (e.g., `-- Goal: identify high-value churn-risk customers`)
- Avoid `SELECT *` — always list fields explicitly
- Use aliases for all tables and fields — but skip meaningless ones like `a`, `b`, `t1`
- Write joins and filters in a structured way — use `JOIN ... ON`, not implicit joins via `WHERE`
- Support metadata tagging — via inline comments or annotations (e.g., `-- @segment: customer_segment_level_3`)
- **SQL version ID:** each query should have a unique identifier, linkable to dashboards or prompts
- **Lint tool integration:** give writers live feedback while editing — not as a blocker, but as helpful guidance

> The goal is clarity, reusability, and better downstream traceability — without killing creativity.
